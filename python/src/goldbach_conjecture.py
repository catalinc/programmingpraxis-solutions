# One of the most famous unproven conjectures in number theory is known as Goldbachâ€™s Conjecture,
# which states that every even number greater than two is the sum of two prime numbers; for example,
# 28 = 5 + 23.
#
# Write a function that finds the two primes that add to a given even number greater than two.
